PoorMakers_IR_Receiver
======================

One of the most common problems encountered when trying to decode IR signals is that makers donâ€™t always have the appropriate IR receiver for the job in hand or have to wait for one to be delivered by mail. Here we present an affordable method to allow you to use any IR emitter (LED) as a receiver and as a bonus we are using an IR Led (emitter), 2 resistors and any standard Arduino. You will also need to download the Arduino code provided here, compile and upload it.
